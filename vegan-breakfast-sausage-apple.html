    <h1>Vegan Apple Maple Breakfast Sausage</h1>
    <p>Ingredients
      - 1 cup Whole Grain Cooked Millet
      - 1 cup Cooked Lentils
      - 1/2 cup Date Paste
      - 2 tablespoons Expeller Pressed Oil
      - 2 tablespoons Hemp Seed
      - 1/2 cup Dried Apples, finely chopped
      - 1/4 cup Potato Starch
      - 2 tablespoons Ground Flaxseed
      - 2 tablespoons Maple Sugar
      - 1 teaspoon Sea Salt
      - 1 teaspoon Ground Fennel Seed
      - 1 teaspoon Thyme
      - 1 teaspoon Black Pepper
      - 1 teaspoon Sage
      - 1 teaspoon Smoked Paprika
      - 1/2 teaspoon Rosemary
      - 1/2 teaspoon Cinnamon
      - 1/4 teaspoon Nutmeg

      Instructions:
      1. **Prepare the Base:**
      - In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooked millet and lentils. Mash them together using a fork or potato masher until you achieve a chunky, but cohesive mixture.

      2. **Add Sweetness and Oil:**
      - Stir in the date paste and expeller pressed oil. Mix well to ensure the sweetness from the date paste is evenly distributed.

      3. **Incorporate Dry Ingredients:**
      - Add the finely chopped dried apples, hemp seeds, potato starch, and ground flaxseed to the mixture. These ingredients will help bind the sausage together and add texture.

      4. **Seasoning:**
      - Sprinkle in the maple sugar, sea salt, ground fennel seed, thyme, black pepper, sage, smoked paprika, rosemary, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Mix thoroughly to ensure the spices are evenly distributed.

      5. **Form the Sausages:**
      - Divide the mixture into equal portions and shape them into small patties or sausage links, depending on your preference.

      6. **Cooking:**
      - Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add a small amount of expeller pressed oil to the skillet.
      - Cook the sausages for about 3-4 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown and crispy on the outside.

      7. **Serve:**
      - Remove the sausages from the skillet and let them rest on a paper towel-lined plate to absorb any excess oil.
      - Serve hot with your favorite vegan breakfast sides, such as scrambled tofu, avocado toast, or a fresh fruit salad.

      **Tips:**

      - If the mixture feels too wet, add a bit more potato starch or ground flaxseed to help bind it.
      - These sausages can be made ahead of time and stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or frozen for longer storage. Reheat in a skillet before serving.
